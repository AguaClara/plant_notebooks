    "# Flow Distribution for the Two Treatment Trains\n",
    "The two 60 L/s trains need separate flow control. We would like a system to split the plant flow evenly between the two trains that would enable flow control with a valve above each entrance tank. This distribution system should keep flow control for each train independent - such that decreasing one train's flow doesn't increase the other's. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Use the Existing 4\" and 6\" Lines\n",
    "The simplest solution is to use the current pressure break as the flow distribution system with the two existing lines (4\" and 6\") as the incoming lines for each train. To make sure this will work, we need to ensure the 4\" line can handle the full 60 L/s"
